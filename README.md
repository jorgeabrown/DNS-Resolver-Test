# DNS-Resolver-Test
This project is intended to test the speed of different DNS resolvers, specifically the default CDE lightband DNS resolver and Cloudflares 1.1.1.1 with WARP. Currently there are no records of CDE Lightbands resolver speed times, but currently Cloudflares product is #3 on the authoritative side of the house.
