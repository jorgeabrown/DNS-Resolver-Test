# Step by Step Data Flow
1. ### Outgoing Traffic Captured by Adapter:
   * All network requests generated by the device (browsing, app usage) are intercepted by the VNIC created by WARP.
2. ### Encryption:
   * The adapter encrypts outgoing data using protocols like WireGuard. This ensures that your traffic remains secure
     and cannot be intercepted by third parties during transmission.
3. ### DNS Query Resolution:
   * For DNS queries, WARP integrates with CloudFlares DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1. These queries are routed security through
     WARP to Cloudflares servers to resolve domain names.
4. ### Routing through Cloudflare Network:
   * Your encrypted traffic is then sent to Cloudflares global network. They efficiently route the data, avoiding congested
     or suboptimal internet paths, which can improve speed and reliability.
5. ### Decryption and Forwarding:
   * Cloudflare decrypts the traffic, processes it, and forwards it to the appropriate destination.
6. ### Returning Traffic:
   * When the destination server responds, the data follows the reverse path. Cloudflare routes it back to your device, encrypts
     the traffic, and sends it through the WARP network adapter.
7. ### Final Delivery:
   * The WARP adapter decrypts the incoming traffic and passes it to your device for use, completing the cycle securely and efficiently.
# Key Features in the Flow:
1. ### Security:
   * Encryption shields your data from interception.
2. ### Performance:
   * Cloudflares optimized routes minimize latency.
3. ### Privacy
   * DNS queries are encrypted and never logged or sold.
